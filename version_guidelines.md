# Bumping versions

Twilio follows the versioning guidelines [here](http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html).

When you are bumping the version number, here is a list of files you need to
update.

* Add a summary of the changes to the CHANGES file in the home directory.

* If necessary, add the contributor to the AUTHORS file.

* Bump the version in the user agent in Services/Twilio.php

* Update the release number in docs/conf.py

* Update the version number in docs/index.rst
